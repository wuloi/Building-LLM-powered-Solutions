**Create intelligent apps and agents with large language models**

## About the book
The book provides a solid theoretical foundation of what LLMs are, their architecture. With a hands-on approach we provide readers with a step-by-step guide to implementing LLM-powered apps for specific tasks and using powerful frameworks like LangChain.

## What you will learn

- Explore the core components of LLM architecture, including encoder-decoder blocks and embeddings
- Understand the unique features of LLMs like GPT-3.5/4, Llama 2, and Falcon LLM
- Use AI orchestrators like LangChain, with Streamlit for the frontend
- Get familiar with LLM components such as memory, prompts, and tools
- Learn how to use non-parametric knowledge and vector databases
- Understand the implications of LFMs for AI research and industry applications
- Customize your LLMs with fine tuning
- Learn about the ethical implications of LLM-powered applications
